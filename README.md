# Tweetotator (Tweet annotator)
## (AKA Reading with Tweeps)

This repository contains a browser extension for seeing what your Tweeps are saying about the pages you browse online.
It (will) work by:

1. Letting you sign-in to Twitter
2. When you visit a new website, searching Twitter for any Tweets from people you follow that include the URL of the
   current webpage you are looking at.
3. Showing you the number of Tweets in the Browser menu icon
4. Showing you the Tweets in a sidebar (toggles by clicking the menu icon)
5. Letting you view/like/re-tweet/comment-on the Tweets (initially by just linking to the Tweet on twitter.com)
